Mnet

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Mnet modules are for perl programmers who want to create network
automation, reporting, and monitoring scripts.

Here's some sample code showing typical usage:

    # use the logging module,
    use Mnet::Log qw(DEBUG INFO WARN FATAL);

    # use the cli option parsing module
    use Mnet::Opts::Cli;

    # use the test record/replay module
    use Mnet::Test;

    # define a cli option for this script
    Mnet::Opts::Cli::define({
        getopt   => "sample:s",
        help_tip => "string cli option",
    });

    # parse cli options
    my $cli = Mnet::Opts::Cli->new;

    # here's a bit of example code
    INFO("sample option set") if $cli->sample;

Refer to the TUTORIAL below to see what can be done with the above code, and
the SEE ALSO section of this perldoc for a complete list of Mnet perl modules.

=head1 TUTORIAL

#? finish tutorial
#   be sure to show use of all main modules, including Mnet::Batch

#? create sample/sample.pl project script
#   contains some type of outline parsing subroutine or module
#       @output or $output = outline_parse($input_outline, $match_re)
#       returns all outline sections that match regex
#       or where would be a good spot to put this code?
#   connect to ios/juniper/other devices available via http://routeserver.org
#   make use of expect ios, batch mode, reports, testing, etc
#   maybe the tutorial covers this ground?
