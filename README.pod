Mnet - Testable network automation and reporting

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Mnet is a set of perl modules which facilitate the development of advanced
network automation scripts.

=head1 FEATURES

The main features of the Mnet perl modules are:

- Facilitate easy log, debug, alert and error output from automation scripts,
output to per-device files, web server output.

- Automation scripts can run in batch mode to concurrently process a list of
devices, using a simple command line argument and a device list file.

- Flexible config settings via command line, environment variable, and/or batch
device list files.

- Reliable automation of cisco IOS and other command line sessions, including
reliable authentication and command prompt handling.

- Record and replay connected command line sessions, speeding the development
of automation scripts and allowing for proper regression testing.

- Report data from scripts can be output as plain .csv files, json, or sql.

- Framework for regression testing of automation scripts, handling multiple
scenarios, making use of session record/replay capabilities.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The Mnet perl modules should work in just about any unix perl environment. To
interact with command line sessions the perl Expect module is required.

This installation is distributed as an Mnet-X.y.tar.gz file. To unpack the
distribution and install it use the following commands:

    tar -xf Mnet-X.y.tar.gz
    cd Mnet-X.y
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The default Makefile.PL install requires root access to copy files to system
perl directories. Set perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/home/path to have
everything installed a different directory.
